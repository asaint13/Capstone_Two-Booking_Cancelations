# Capstone_Two-Booking_Cancelations

This repo will hold all the notebooks and files associated with the Booking_Cancelations project.
For this project I'll be working on the Kaggle Hotel booking demand dataset.
There is a detailed project proposal detailing what the goal of the project is.
I will also include the several jupyter notebooks detailing my work as I move from wrangling to EDA and finally modeling.
The project will also include a report detailing the findings and whether the goals were achieved.
